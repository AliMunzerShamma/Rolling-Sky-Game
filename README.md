Game Rules and Mechanics
The main objective of the game is to control a ball operated by the player.

The ball moves along a path with several obstacles.

The player must navigate the ball to avoid colliding with any of the obstacles in its way.

The player can control the ball using the following buttons:

Right Arrow: Moves the ball to the right.
Left Arrow: Moves the ball to the left.
Space: Makes the ball jump a certain distance depending on how long the Space button is pressed.
Ball Speed Mechanics:

At the start of each level, the ball moves at a fixed speed of 11 units.
The speed increases by 10 units for every 30 units the ball travels along the X-axis.
The player can increase the ball's speed at will by pressing the Up Arrow.
To revert the ball's speed to its original value (before the speed increase), the player can press the Down Arrow.
